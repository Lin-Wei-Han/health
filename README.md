You can include R chunks like so:

summary(people)
#>       age            weight          height     
#>  Min.   :21.00   Min.   :56.00   Min.   :156.0  
#>  1st Qu.:28.00   1st Qu.:64.00   1st Qu.:161.5  
#>  Median :41.00   Median :71.00   Median :168.0  
#>  Mean   :43.41   Mean   :71.07   Mean   :168.3  
#>  3rd Qu.:53.00   3rd Qu.:78.00   3rd Qu.:174.5
